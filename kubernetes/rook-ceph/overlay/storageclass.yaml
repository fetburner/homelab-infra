    # RBD image format. Defaults to "2".
    imageFormat: "2"

    # RBD image features
    # Available for imageFormat: "2". Older releases of CSI RBD
    # support only the `layering` feature. The Linux kernel (KRBD) supports the
    # full complement of features as of 5.4
    # `layering` alone corresponds to Ceph's bitfield value of "2" ;
    # `layering` + `fast-diff` + `object-map` + `deep-flatten` + `exclusive-lock` together
    # correspond to Ceph's OR'd bitfield value of "63". Here we use
    # a symbolic, comma-separated format:
    # For 5.4 or later kernels:
    imageFeatures: layering,fast-diff,object-map,deep-flatten,exclusive-lock
    # For 5.3 or earlier kernels:
    #imageFeatures: layering
